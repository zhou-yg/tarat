# 最小的描述逻辑工具

With evolution of core I'd found that existing a more explicity tool to express logic

this tool mayeb extrat from Tarat as independent library for React or Vue

its one of features is that function calling driven with proxy

basis consists

- signal
  - as state
  - as computed by receive Function type parameter
- patch
  - batch change the signal by using a series Patch
- effect
  - handle the effect by system changing
- progress
  - states = [init, pending, idle]
  - monitor middle state of signal
- spy
  - provide to debugging tool


基于实现应该是框架无关的，这样可以跨框架/平台，但任需提供对应框架的adaptor

## 拓展

在这个基础上，再设计拓展机制和前后端一体化的通信，就可以形成现在的core 

如果做完了就需要大量重构了core part，脑壳痛
